 Analytics

 The data collected is limited to basic onboarding interactions and preferences. No personally identifiable information, job details, employment history, or documents are collected. No analytics data is collected during your actual use of the app after completing the onboarding process.

 Data Security
</Heading>
<Text>
 Audio processing occurs entirely on your device. Text processing of your interview questions is handled securely by our AI provider using industry-standard encryption. No personal data or content is transmitted to our servers. Any data stored in files remains local to your device or within your iCloud, depending on your storage settings.

 We implement industry-standard security measures to protect any data that may be processed through our service. However, as no system is completely secure, we recommend using strong security practices on your devices.

 Our app may request access to your device&apos;s microphone to enable interview recording functionality.
